Designed and implemented a functional and intuitive web application with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

• Extracted information from OpenWeatherMap.org API in the form of dictionary.

• Entities like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc are then parsed to json objects and portrayed on the web application
in a captivating order.

• Improved its features by linking new cities on the main page and deleting pre-existing cities by delete requests from the
database. Invalid cities flash an error messages using flash library.
